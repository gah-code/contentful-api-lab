# 📦 Contentful API Lab

This lab serves as a sandbox environment for developing, testing, and refining the API-driven content architecture behind [Gilberto Haro’s portfolio and blog site](https://github.com/gah-code/gilbertoharosite). It focuses on dynamic data fetching from Contentful, modeling structured content types like blog posts and portfolio projects, and ensuring smooth CRUD operations through tools like Postman. The lab will support real-time CMS updates via webhooks, with a goal of maintaining a scalable, developer-friendly, and production-ready content pipeline.
